This is a simple weather App made using HTML, CSS, JS and API. You can lookup the current weather of a city using this app. It also has error handling which gives an error message if wrong city name is entered. It is still an ongoing project. For now for the project to work you have to use your own API key inside the config.js file. You have to create a variable called apiKey and store your API key there and when you open the project with live server, it will work and display the current temperature and humidity of the city you enter.
